#Deepdive is a program that can be taught the relatedness between different data sets, types, and objects. OBIS is a data base containg spatial data, along with other data set collected on different species. This progrma will teach deep dive to differentiate between the latitude and longitude coordinates that are fed in from OBIS as well as times of divergence of related species of sharks. Using a scale, deep dive wil lcreate an out put showing relatedness in comparison to typical geogrpahic cloesness of fish species. This will hopefully offer insight into the lvel of relatedness between species and their spatial closeness. When applied to many species, this program could reveal broad patterns betwen evolutionary relatedness and spatial distribtution in aquatic systems.
